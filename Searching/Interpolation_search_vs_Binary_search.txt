---------------------------------Interpolation search vs Binary search---------------------------------



Interpolation search works better than Binary Search for a Sorted and Uniformly Distributed array. 

Binary Search goes to the middle element to check irrespective of search-key. On the other hand, Interpolation Search may go to different locations according to search-key. If the value of the search-key is close to the last element, Interpolation Search is likely to start search toward the end side.

On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(n)) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where n is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(n) comparisons.
