Begin
   function dijkstra() to find minimum distance:
   1) Create a set Set that keeps track of vertices included in shortest
   path tree, Initially, the set is empty.
   2) A distance value is assigned to all vertices in the input graph.
   Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Distance value is assigned as
   0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.
   3) While Set doesnâ€™t include all vertices
      a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in the Set and has minimum distance value.
      b) Include u to Set.
      c) Distance value is updated of all adjacent vertices of u.
      For updating the distance values, iterate through all adjacent
      vertices. if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of
      edge u-v for every adjacent vertex v, is less than the distance value
      of v, then update the distance value of v.
